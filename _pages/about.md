I am passionate about `Robotics and Software`, always seeking opportunities to expand both personally and professionally. My primary areas of interest are , and I have hands-on experience in navigation , path planning for both UAV's (drones) and AGVs in outdoor and indoor environments . This comes from my previous involvement in projects like a Agriculture surveillance , mapping and spraying drones, autonomous warehouse stock counting system.

Along with that i have contributed in hardware development of drones and mobile robots, espcially in electronics. with early part i've also gained alot of experience in sourcing and procurement of hardware. 

I am currently based in the city of `Barcelona` working for `WeCrunch` on Drone and AGV based autonomous warehouse management system. At the same time I am studying a Master's course on `Automatic Controls and Robotics` at the [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca).

As a summary, I count with `almost 5` years of experience working with:
* C++
* Python
* ROS and ROS2
* Ubuntu
* Controls and Motion Planning
* Electronics Design and Development
* Procurement and Commissioning

Here you can take a look at my skills, projects I have been working on and some hobbies. In conclusion, anything that makes me happy in this life.
